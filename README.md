# Chat with a Gemini model created using Google API

This project uses React, Javascript, NodeJS, and Gemini to create a simple web chat.

To run this chat in the development mode to view it in your browser you have to open two terminals and run the following scripts in each of them in the following order: 

### 1.`npm run start:frontend`
### 2.`npm run start:backend`

The page will reload when you make changes.
This app will only work if you also create a '.env' file with your GOOGLE_GEN_API_KEY 

`GOOGLE_GEN_API_KEY=xxxxx`

To get your API key, visit the Google website that contains the documentation, available at:  https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/api-key
